# H1 Zombie Survivial
Concept: “It’s like a zombie shooter, but you do not want to shoot the zombies.”
Genre: shooter, survival
Platform: desktop only
Story: You are a zombie apocalypse survivor, making your way to a camp. On your journey, you run into a large zombie horde. Your goal is to make you way past the zombies, either by avoiding them or killing them all. (Themes: fear, survival) 
Esthetics: cartoonish, 8-bit sound, only has sound effects for shooting and zombies

Mechanism: The player has two ways to play the game: kill zombies or avoid them. If they decide to go on a killing spree, they will earn more points, but 2 more zombies will spawn for every zombie they kill, making the game harder. However, if they avoid zombies and only kill one when necessary, they will survive longer.
More mechanics: Endless game, behavioral momentum, virtual items (power-ups)

Controls: keyboard for gameplay, mouse for menu navigation

The game will have a control menu to teach them controls but they will not be taught the different strategies; they will learn those through experimenting and playing the game.
In order to do well in the game, the player will need to learn how good the three power-ups, the bomb, health pack, and extra heart, are. The bomb destroys all zombies on the screen (without spawning 2 more), and the health pack and extra heart items help you survive longer. The player will also need to learn about the two strategies, after noticing that killing zombies spawns more zombies.
